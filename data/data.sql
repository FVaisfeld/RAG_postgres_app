Microsofts CEOs
Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Redmond, USA wurde im Jahr 1975 von Bill Gates und Paul Allen gegründet. Bill Gates wurde Microsofts erster CEO und zählt heute zu den reichsten Menschen der Welt. Im Jahr 2000 löste ihn Steve Ballmer als Vorstandsvorsitzender der Microsoft Corporation ab. Der Sohn eines Schweizer Einwanderers war seit 1980 im Unternehmen beschäftigt und hat vor seiner Ernennung zum CEO verschiedene Bereiche im Unternehmen geleitet, u.a. die Entwicklung der Betriebssysteme und den Vertrieb. Nach 14 Jahren an der Spitze des Konzerns wurde Ballmer im Jahr 2014 von Satya Nadella als CEO von Microsoft abgelöst.

Internet companies generate their revenue through various means. For instance, Google uses its advertisement services, such as Google AdWords – which takes advantage of Google searches and appears as small advertisements next to search results – and Google AdSense, which generates advertisements based on a user''s search history and location, among others. Advertisements based on AdSense appear across Google-owned sites, including YouTube and Google Finance. The online company also profits from the development of Android OS, licensing, and mobile apps, as well as the recent development of hardware such as the Nexus mobile device series and Google Glass.

Yandex: a snapshot
Like Google, Yandex’s search engine is the primary contact point with the company, but the company’s services go well beyond search. Incorporated in the Netherlands and with offices around the world, Yandex offers services primarily to the Russian language market covering ecommerce, navigation, advertising, mobile development as well as ride-sharing service and car sharing services. The segment of e-commerce, mobility, and delivery is the company’s primary source of revenue. In 2022, the company had a net income of 47.6 billion Russian rubles, with the net income before income taxes amounting to 70.4 billion Russian rubles.
Global search market

 Apple Inc. Revenue

Apple produces a wide range of consumer electronics, software, and more recently, IT-related services such as cloud storage and mobile payment processing. The company is one of the world’s greatest generators of revenue, raking in hundreds of billions of dollars around the world each year. The Americas region has always been Apple’s strongest market, with the U.S. making up a large portion of the company’s revenue both in the Americas region and overall. Founded and currently headquartered in California, it is no surprise that the company has such a strong presence in the U.S. market. Many of the company’s breakthrough consumer electronics products such as the iPhone and iPod first gained popularity in U.S. markets, but its domestic strength has allowed Apple to additionally pursue businesses in markets around the world.

 Apple products

Consumer electronics products are the cornerstone of Apple’s success. Over 45 percent of smartphone users in the U.S. use some version of the company’s iPhone device, making it the country’s most popular smartphone product by far.

As such, gaming software sales for the companies increased in 2021 and are expected to fully take off in 2022 when the initial limited availability of the consoles has been overcome.

Microsoft and Bill Gates

Microsoft has become a constant figure among the world’s most valuable brands. Its founder Bill Gates is presently, and perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the richest men in the United States and among the richest billionaires worldwide, among other well-known figures such as Warren Buffet, Carlos Slim Helu, and Larry Ellison.

In addition to his status as an entrepreneur, Bill Gates is also known for his philanthropy. In 2000, together with his wife, they created the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation has donated a considerable amount of money, in particular in the area of research and development of treatments for neglected diseases.

While Bill Gates no longer heads the Microsoft Corporation, the company itself continues to show extremely strong results around the world, with versions of its most famous product, the Windows operating system, consistently leading the home operating system market.

Thanks in part to the rapid growth in these two areas, 2023 proved to be the company’s most successful year ever in terms of annual revenue, with the total figure reaching over 211 billion dollars.
Microsoft Corporation
Since its foundation in 1975, Microsoft has grown into one of the most successful tech firms in the world and has experienced years of continued success. In order to ensure that this growth persists, the company has added tens of thousands of employees over the past decade and invested billions into research and development. Some of Microsoft’s major business ventures include its Windows operating system, various lines of consumer electronics, software packages such as Microsoft Office, as well as newer offerings such as cloud computing capabilities.

Intelligent cloud segment
As Microsoft''s fastest-growing business, intelligent cloud replaced the more personal computing segment in FY2020 to become the company''s largest business segment. The intelligent cloud segment contains Microsoft''s public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services, such as Azure, SQL Server, etc. Together with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure is one of the most popular cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offerings. The intelligent cloud segment, however, does not reflect the totality of Microsoft''s cloud business, as Office 365 - the company''s popular cloud collaboration solution - is grouped under the productivity and business processes segment.

 Apple products

Apple began as a computer manufacturer in the garage of Steve Job’s parents. After decades focused on computer hardware and software, the launch of the iPhone in 2007 changed the company significantly. In spite of competition in the smartphone market, the share of U.S. smartphone users that uses the iPhone is higher than it was in 2014. Apple also now sells tablets, branded as iPads, and wearables such as the Apple Watch.

 Apple’s business side

(6233796, 'Google India: revenue 2022 # Revenue of Google India from financial year 2015 to 2022 (in billion Indian rupees) # Google India revenue FY 2015-2022 # In the fiscal year 2022, Google India''s revenue rose again to pre-pandemic levels at nearly 94 billion Indian rupees. The company’s overall profits in the country saw yet another leap by 48 percent compared to the previous year. IT services were the key revenue generator that year, accounting for 52 percent.

 What made the revenue slip to such a low?

To understand this, it is important to note that Google’s advertising revenue is the biggest contributor to its overall revenue. And while Google is the undisputed leader in India’s mobile search engine market, its biggest cash cow- Google AdWords, is registered under the Google Asia Pacific division. As such, the profits from AdWords cannot be filed as part of the Indian division without being taxed. This is mainly owing to the newly imposed accounting standards in India, aimed at providing more transparency in the way technology companies report their financial results.

 Why India Inc. matters

This certainly comes as a blow to the company since India is one of the fastest growing digital ad markets, expected to be worth almost 560 billion rupees by fiscal year 2024. But the tech giant is poised to expand its niche from advertising to other future-driven products including digital payments, cloud computing and more, for which India serves as a fertile testing ground.

Bitesize info on Apple’s financials

With an estimated brand value of over 947 billion U.S. dollars, Apple beat Google and Amazon in the running for the title of world’s most valuable brand in 2022. During the past decade, the California-based technology titan has expanded and innovated its product and service portfolio at an impressive pace, now serving millions of loyal customers worldwide. Company reports highlighted that Apple’s revenue jumped from just under 275 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 to over 365 billion in 2021, marking an unparalleled annual boost of one hundred billion. The lion’s share of this sum was generated via sales of the iPhone – Apple’s most profitable operating segment by far.

Apple’s position in the online advertising market

Apple’s growth is primarily supported by device sales, whereas its advertising business only accounts for a small fraction of total revenues. This distribution of revenue streams looks fundamentally different from other tech giants. For example, Amazon reported advertising takings of around 31.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2021, whereas Google’s ad revenues peaked at 210 billion U.S. dollars that year. But even though Apple remains a comparatively small fish in the online advertising pond, the company’s advertising endeavors are still worth looking out for – especially those that center around its Search Ads feature.

(6757848, 'Gewinn von Apple Inc. bis 2023 # Nettogewinn von Apple Inc. in den Geschäftsjahren von 2005 bis 2023 (in Milliarden US-Dollar) # Gewinn von Apple bis 2023 # Apple Inc. erzielte im Geschäftsjahr 2023 (von Oktober 2022 bis September 2023) einen Gewinn von rund 97 Milliarden US-Dollar. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr, in dem der Nettogewinn bei einem Wert von 99,8 Milliarden US-Dollar gelegen hatte, entspricht dies einem Rückgang um rund 2,8 Prozent.

Starkes Wachstum

Das Unternehmen aus dem kalifornischen Cupertino hat sich innerhalb des letzten Jahrzehnts zu einem der profitabelsten und größten Unternehmen der Welt entwickelt. Maßgeblichen Anteil an dieser Entwicklung hat vor allem ein Produkt – das iPhone. Im Jahr 2007, in dem Apple das Smartphone auf den Markt brachte, betrug der Jahresumsatz des Unternehmens noch rund 25 Milliarden US-Dollar. In den folgenden Jahren sind die Erlöse dann rasant gewachsen und im Geschäftsjahr 2023 konnte ein Umsatz von gut 383 Milliarden US-Dollar erzielt werden.

iPhone-Abhängigkeit

Das Unternehmen ist relativ stark von den iPhone-Verkäufen abhängig. Das seit 2007 im Handel verfügbare Smartphone macht einen Großteil von Apples Gesamtumsatz aus. Um sich von dieser Abhängigkeit zu lösen, versucht Apple seine Produktpalette weiter zu vergrößern. Neben weiteren Hardware-Produkten, wie Tablets und Smartwatches, setzt das Unternehmen verstärkt auf digitalen Content. Dementsprechend wachsen die Umsätze mit iTunes, Software und Services stetig. Im Frühjahr 2019 kündigte Apple zudem an, mit einem eigenen Streaming-Dienst für Serien und Filme in Konkurrenz zu etablierten Anbietern wie Netflix und Amazon treten zu wollen.

(6764355, 'Google revenue Russia 2022 # Revenue of Google in Russia from 2014 to 2022 (in billion Russian rubles) # Google revenue in Russia 2014-2022 # The revenue of OOO Google, the Russian subsidiary of Google, exceeded 24 billion Russian rubles in 2022, having significantly decreased from the previous year. From 2014 to 2021, the company''s earnings in Russia marked a continuous increase. In June 2022, OOO Google submitted a bankruptcy declaration.

(7646365, 'Google: quarterly revenue 2023 # Revenue of Google from 1st quarter 2008 to 3rd quarter 2023 (in million U.S. dollars) # Google: quarterly revenue 2008-2023 # In the third quarter of 2023, Google''s revenue amounted to over 76.3 billion U.S. dollars, up from the 68.2 billion U.S. dollars registered in the same quarter a year prior. The company amounted an annual revenue of 279.8 billion U.S. dollars throughout 2022, its highest value to date, with most of its earnings being powered by advertising through Google sites and its network.


Google advertising
The foundations of Google''s earnings are its advertising revenues, generated through its Google Ads platform, which enables advertisers to display ads, product listings, and service offerings across its extensive network (properties, partner sites, and apps) to web users via programs like AdSense or AdSearch. In 2022, Google accounted for most of its parent company Alphabet''s annual revenues with 191.7 billion U.S. dollars in Google website ad revenues alone.


Other sources of revenue
Google''s multitude of income sources also includes digital content products and apps sold through the digital content distribution platform Google Play, as well as hardware including Chromecast devices and smartphones.

Intelligent Cloud segment leads Microsoft’s revenues  

Founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company that develops and sells a wide range of consumer and enterprise software, hardware, services, and consumer electronics. In its 2021 financial year, Microsoft generated most of its revenue from its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Microsoft''s popular cloud flatform Azure. The Productivity and Business Processes segment, including the successful line of the Office products, also brings in an increasing amount of revenues. The rapid growths in these segments contributed to making 2021 the company’s most successful year in terms of annual revenue, which amounted to more than 168 billion U.S. dollars.

Microsoft''s income growth is equally impressive

Not only has Microsoft seen great evolution in terms of sales, the company has been making better and better profits as well. Microsoft''s annual net income reached 73 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal year 2022, delivering an impressive margin of over 35 percent. In a time when the COVID-19 pandemic imposed social distancing and remote working practices onto businesses and individuals, technology companies such as Microsoft provide the essential tools that make such practices possible.

Gewinn von Alphabet

Im Vergleich zum Vorjahresquartal stieg der Überschuss von Alphabet im vierten Quartal 2023 von rund 13,62 auf 20,69 Milliarden US-Dollar. Im Vorquartal belief sich der Überschuss auf rund 19,7 Milliarden US-Dollar. Im ersten Quartal 2019 wurde das Ergebnis des Unternehmens besonders durch die im März 2019 von der EU-Kommission verhängte Kartellbuße in Höhe von 1,7 Milliarden US-Dollar belastet. Begründet wurde die Strafe damit, dass Google seine marktbeherrschende Position im Suchmaschinengeschäft missbraucht habe.

Die Suchmaschine Google

Die Suchmaschine Google ist mit einem Marktanteil von über 80 Prozent – gemessen am Anteil der Suchanfragen über Desktop-PC und Laptops – Marktführer im globalen Suchmaschinenmarkt sowie meistaufgerufene Website der Welt. Auch in Deutschland ist Google die beliebteste Suchmaschine.

(14826826, 'Alphabet - Gewinn 2023 # Gewinn bzw. Verlust von Alphabet vom 1. Quartal 2013 bis zum 4. Quartal 2023 (in Milliarden US-Dollar) # Gewinn bzw. Verlust von Alphabet bis zum 4. Quartal 2023 # Für das vierte Quartal 2023 konnte Alphabet einen Gewinn in Höhe von rund 20,7 Milliarden US-Dollar ausweisen. Das US-amerikanische Tech-Unternehmen profierte zuletzt vom weltweiten KI-Hype und konnte so seine Geschäftszahlen deutlich verbessern.
Im ersten Quartal 2019 wurde der Gewinn des Unternehmens besonders durch die im März 2019 von der EU-Kommission verhängte Kartellbuße in Höhe von 1,7 Milliarden US-Dollar belastet. Zu der Strafe kam es, weil Google seine marktbeherrschende Position im Online-Werbemarkt missbraucht haben soll.

Umsatz von Alphabet

Im vierten Quartal 2023 hat Alphabet einen Umsatz in Höhe von rund 86,3 Milliarden US-Dollar erwirtschaftet. Der größte Umsatzanteil wurde dabei mit rund 85,5 Milliarden US-Dollar vom Tochterunternehmen Google beigesteuert.

Marktanteil der Suchmaschine Google

Die Suchmaschine des Tech-Riesen aus Mountain-View ist mit einem Marktanteil von über 80 Prozent, gemessen am Anteil der Suchanfragen über Desktop-PCs und Laptops, Marktführer im globalen Suchmaschinenmarkt.

 Apple Inc.

Since its now famous beginning in a California garage, Apple has grown into one of the biggest companies in the world, with its market capitalization amounting to 2.75 trillion U.S. dollars. The company brings in hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars in revenue each year and has revolutionized the consumer electronics industry time and time again with a range of massively successful product lines. Although still primarily a consumer electronics vendor, the company has also begun to branch out into a variety of service-based businesses including Apple Pay, iTunes, and iCloud storage.

 Apple’s sales revenue

The company generates advertising revenue through its Google Ads platform, which enables advertisers to display ads, product listings and service offerings across Google’s extensive ad network (properties, partner sites, and apps) to web users.

Google advertising
Advertising accounts for the majority of Google’s revenue, which amounted to a total of 305.63 billion U.S. dollars in 2023. The majority of Google''s advertising revenue comes from search advertising.

Google market share
These revenue figures come as no surprise, as Google accounts for the majority of the online and mobile search market worldwide. As of September 2023, Google was responsible for more than 84 percent of global desktop search traffic.

 Apple revenue - additional information

Apple Computer, Inc.  was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007, in order to reflect the brand’s extension into other segments of the consumer electronics market. The company, founded in 1976, went on to grow from a two-man operation to a worldwide record-breaking phenomenon. In its 2022 financial year, Apple reported 383 billion U.S. dollars in revenues, compared to eight billion U.S. dollars in 2004.



Since the 2001 launch of the iPod in 2001, Apple has invested billions in research and development of new products, in order to answer ever changing consumer needs. Apple’s most profitable division is its hardware segment, which includes products such as the Macintosh computer series, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad , or Apple TV. Additionally, Apple offers consumers a number of software products, such as the OS X and iOS operating systems and web-based services, such as the Mac App Store and the iOS App Store, iTunes Store, iBooks, or iCloud.

 Apple''s iPhone is its most successful product

Released in 2007 and already in its eighth generation in 2014, the iPhone is Apple’s most successful product, with over 1.5 billion units sold since its launch. It is credited with almost singlehandedly making Apple one of the most valuable brands in the world. The iPhone also has a very strong brand retention, surpassing all other smartphone brands.

Apple iPhone revenue

The Apple iPhone is one of the biggest success stories in the smartphone industry. Since its introduction to the market in 2007, Apple has sold more than 1.5 billion units worldwide. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, the Apple iPhone’s market share of new smartphone sales was over 24 percent. Much of its accomplishments can be attributed to Apple’s ability to keep the product competitive throughout the years, with new releases and updates.

Apple iPhone growth
The iPhone has shown to be a crucial product for Apple, considering that the iPhone’s share of the company’s total revenue has consistently grown over the years. In the first quarter of 2009, the iPhone sales were responsible for about a quarter of Apple’s revenue. In the first quarter of FY 2024, this figure reached a high of roughly 58 percent, equating to over 69.7 billion U.S. dollars in that quarter.

Google’s revenue
Founded in 1998, Google is a multinational internet service corporation headquartered in California, United States. Initially conceptualized as a web search engine based on a PageRank algorithm, Google now offers a multitude of desktop, mobile and online products. Google Search remains the company’s core web-based product along with advertising services, communication and publishing tools, development and statistical tools as well as map-related products.

Google is also the producer of the mobile operating system Android, Chrome OS, Google TV as well as desktop and mobile applications such as the internet browser Google Chrome or mobile web applications based on pre-existing Google products. Recently, Google has also been developing selected pieces of hardware which ranges from the Nexus series of mobile devices to smart home devices and driverless cars. Due to its immense scale, Google also offers a crisis response service covering disasters, turmoil and emergencies, as well as an open source missing person finder in times of disaster. Despite the vast scope of Google products, the company still collects the majority of its revenue through online advertising on Google Site and Google network websites.

 Apple’s iPad revenue – additional information

Introduced to the consumer market in 2010, the iPad is Apple’s tablet computer. This particular device was a pioneer in the tablet market, and aims to fill a gap between smartphones and laptop computers by offering another mobile device option for consumers. The iPad uses the same operating system and multi-touch user interface as the iPhone and the iPod Touch. In the third quarter of 2023, Apple shipped around 12.5 million tablets worldwide, and has released multiple versions of the device.

 Apple’s iPad performance

In FY 2023, iPad sales generated about 28 billion U.S. dollars in revenues. In the third quarter of 2013 (2Q ’13 calendar year), iPad revenue accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total global revenue, the highest share to date. In the latest quarter, iPad sales accounted for nearly about seven percent of Apple’s total global revenue.

 Competition

With the success of the iPad over the years, Apple has established itself as the leading vendor in the tablet market. The company’s market share has been steadily decreasing over the years though, going from around 60 percent in 2011 to over 30 percent in 2023. Samsung is Apple’s main competitor in the market, while Chinese brands Lenovo and Huawei, and Amazon also have significant market shares. As competitors strengthen their presence in the market, Apple’s tablet operating system, iOS, has lost the position of leading tablet operating system in late 2012.

(14828297, 'Apple sales revenue by country/region 2024 # Revenue of Apple by geographical region from the first quarter of 2012 to 1st quarter 2024 (in billion U.S. dollars) # Apple''s revenue broken down by geographical region 2012-2024, by quarter # The Americas are Apple’s largest regional market, bringing in net sales of 50.43 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of the company’s 2023 fiscal year. Europe and Greater China are two other major markets for Apple.



U.S.: Apple’s biggest market

The high revenue generated from the Americas is largely due to Apple’s strong performance in their home market, the United States. Apple has the largest market share among smartphone vendors in the U.S. by a large margin. Although international sales have a growing share of Apple’s total revenue, the U.S. still counts for over 44 percent of Apple’s net sales. The U.S. also has the highest concentration of Apple stores, which is Apple’s own chain of retail stores that showcase and sell Apple’s various products including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, among others.



iPhone: Apple’s most profitable product

The iPhone, initially released in 2007, became Apple’s most successful product: The share of iPhone sales consistently amount to more than 40 percent of Apple’s overall share of sales. The early generations of iPhone revolutionized the mobile phone industry and popularized the use of smartphones.

 Apple revenue streams

Apple registered its highest revenue to date in FY 2022, when the company’s revenue stood at over 383 billion U.S. dollars. Apple’s success over the years can be explained by strong brand loyalty, and the constant release of innovative products, updates and features. The iPod, for example, was one of the first successful releases of the company to the consumer market. However, according to industry experts, the increased capacity of smartphones to play and store music led to the decline of digital music devices sales, such as the iPod.

 Rise of Apple iPhone

Since its introduction in 2007, Apple’s iPhone has gained space in the market. In the first quarter of Apple''s 2024 financial year iPhone sales revenue stood at almost 70 billion U.S. dollars. The increase in devices sales had a direct impact on the iPhone’s share of the company’s total revenue. In the beginning of 2009, sales of the iPhone accounted for about 25 percent of Apple’s total revenue. By the first quarter of 2024, this share was at almost 60 percent.

 Other products and services

Apple’s iPad tablet, the Mac computer and costumer services are important revenue streams as well for Apple.

Alphabet has several operating segments, including Google and Other Bets. Google is the only reportable segment, as none of the other segments meet the quantitative revenue thresholds to qualify as reportable segments. In 2022, Google segment revenue amounted to 305.6 billion U.S. dollars. During the same fiscal period, the Other Bets segment revenue amounted to 1.52 billion U.S. dollars in total.
According to the company, the Google product segment includes “revenues from the company’s main products Ads, Android, Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Maps, digital content distribution platform Google Play, Hardware, Search and YouTube. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings.”

Alphabet’s businesses not only include Google but also a wide range of other companies across various, mostly digital-related verticals.
